# Changelog

All notable changes to the API that the frontend should be aware of.

## 2026-06-01

### Added

#### New endpoints

**`GET /api/clinic/nearby`** — geospatial clinic search for the map screen.

Query parameters (all optional unless noted):

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lat` | double | yes | — | Caller's latitude (-90 to 90) |
| `lng` | double | yes | — | Caller's longitude (-180 to 180) |
| `radiusKm` | double | no | 5 | Search radius in km |
| `specialization` | string | no | — | Filter to clinics with at least one doctor of this specialty |
| `search` | string | no | — | Name / government / area contains match |

Response is `NearbyClinicDto[]`, sorted ascending by `distanceKm`. Public (no auth required).

**`GET /api/doctor/nearby`** — geospatial doctor search for the map screen. Same query parameters as the clinic version. Returns `NearbyDoctorDto[]`, sorted ascending by `distanceKm`. Public.

Notes:
- Both endpoints only return items that have `latitude` AND `longitude` set on at least one active clinic. Items without coordinates are silently excluded.
- Invalid coordinates (e.g. `lat=999`) return an empty list with `200`, not an error.
- A doctor's location is taken from the first active clinic with coordinates. If a doctor works at multiple clinics, `clinicIdForLocation` tells you which one was used.

#### New fields on existing responses

**`GET /api/doctor/{id}`** (response: `DoctorProfileDto`):

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `clinicLatitude` | double? | Active clinic's latitude (null if no active clinic or clinic has no coords) |
| `clinicLongitude` | double? | Active clinic's longitude |
| `totalPatients` | int | Distinct registered patients with non-cancelled appointments. Excludes walk-ins. |

**`GET /api/doctor`** and **`GET /api/doctor/popular`** (response: `DoctorListItemDto`):

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `distanceKm` | double? | Haversine distance from caller to the doctor's active clinic. Null unless `userLat` + `userLng` were provided AND the doctor has a clinic with coordinates. |

#### New optional query parameters

**`GET /api/doctor`** now accepts:

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `userLat` | double? | If both `userLat` and `userLng` are provided, results are sorted ascending by `distanceKm` and `distanceKm` is populated per item. |
| `userLng` | double? | Same. |

**`GET /api/doctor/popular`** now accepts the same `userLat` / `userLng` pair. Results stay sorted by rating (popular order is preserved) but `distanceKm` is populated per item.

All existing query parameters on both endpoints are unchanged.

#### New DTO shapes (for reference)

```jsonc
// NearbyClinicDto (extends ClinicDto)
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Cairo Medical Center",
  "government": "Cairo",
  "area": "Downtown",
  "address": "...",
  "latitude": 30.0444,
  "longitude": 31.2357,
  "isActive": true,
  "doctorsCount": 12,
  "distanceKm": 0.842,           // NEW
  "matchingDoctorsCount": 3      // NEW — doctors matching the specialization filter
}

// NearbyDoctorDto (extends DoctorListItemDto)
{
  "id": 1,
  "fullName": "Dr. ...",
  "specialization": "Cardiology",
  "profileImageUrl": "...",
  "consultationFee": 250.00,
  "averageRating": 4.6,
  "totalReviews": 48,
  "isAvailable": true,
  "clinicName": "...",
  "clinicArea": "...",
  "isFavorited": false,
  "latitude": 30.0444,
  "longitude": 31.2357,
  "distanceKm": 1.205,           // inherited from DoctorListItemDto
  "clinicIdForLocation": 1       // NEW — the clinic whose coords were used
}
```

### Fixed

- **`GET /api/doctor` was returning HTTP 500.** Caused by a missing AutoMapper mapping (`Doctor -> DoctorListItemDto`) on the backend. The endpoint now returns `200` with a `DoctorListItemDto[]` as it was always supposed to. If your app was silently catching this as a generic server error, you can now remove any error-toast logic that fired on the doctor browse screen.

### Not changed

- No database schema changes. No migration needed on the backend, and no client-side data migration needed.
- All previously-existing endpoints, query parameters, and response fields are unchanged. New fields are additive — existing JSON parsers will ignore them.

### Out of scope (still not in this release)

- AI Chatbot
- Social login (Google / Apple / Facebook)
- Structured prescription storage (current JSON-in-text storage continues to work)
